# Vim Introduction #

Enough with the notion and other fancy shit, now I decided to write in markdown. Fast, easy and flexible and customizable. Hence I am learning Vim.

 - Vim is an open source text editor, that can use in the terminal. Vim has specific key binding and motions that enable you to move fastly on the keyboard. Reducing time and preventing the glossy fuck all shit that you used till now. 

 - it is light weight, a little hard to learn but eventually easy.

	Be fast and efficient
