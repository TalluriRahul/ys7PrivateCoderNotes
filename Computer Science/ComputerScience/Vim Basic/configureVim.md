After setting up the file, you can change the various settings like these
```js
		set number //used to set line number on the side of the text editor
		set relativenumber //same as above but the numbers are relative to the cursor position
		set autoindent //autom indents stuff.
		set mouse=a //set mouse active in the vi session
		colorscheme <scheme name> //set colorScheme/theme.
```

then do `:wq` to apply the settings. 

you can add other parameters well.
